# Python-API-Challenge

Demonstrated use of api keys, pandas dataframes and mapping. Used openweatherapi to discover relationships between location latitude and several weather metrics. Used returned data to narrow dataframe to potential vacation cities based on agreeable weather metrics and populated map with possible lodging using geoapify. 

Used a python IDE, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Numpy and CitiPy. Data sourced from openweatherapi and geoapify. Infographics and coding can be found in this repository.
